# CS4012-HTML-Project-AY20/21
This is a group assignment (four per group) to produce a web site for a not for profit (fictional) organisation. The site must be built using just a text editor (e.g. Notepad++). Web building tools are not allowed.

## The assignment must include:
```
• Multiple pages
• Multiple HTML Elements
• Images
• Audio
• Video
```

## The assignment will be graded on the following:
```
• Look and feel: That is, does this look like it could really be a company website?
• Overall effort: Did the group seem to put a lot of thought behind this? Or was it just thrown together in a few minutes?
• Ease of use.
• Is the website logically arranged? Don't simply put everything together on one page. Divide the website up into several pages and make the navigation between them clear.
• Multimedia: Does the website exhibit the HTML based multimedia suggested? Does it do so in a sensible manner?
• Well-formed HTML: Is the HTML properly written? For example, all opening tags have corresponding closing tags, etc.
• CSS: Have you used style sheets appropriately?
• Use of absolute/relative file paths as appropriate.
• Adherence to the guidelines: Did the group follow the assignment instructions?
```
